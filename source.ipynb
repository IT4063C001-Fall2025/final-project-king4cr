    "I hypothesize that toal screen time per day is negatively correlated with student GPA especially when screen time is used more for non academic use. Then I think academic screen time may show a positive or somewhat neutral correlation while bedtime screen time likely messes with sleep duration and qaulity which would contribute to poor academic and mental health outcome. Lastly I think that students who use screen time management tools will show better sleep, higher GPA, and a better well being. "
